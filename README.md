# OOP-eBanking-APP

I implemented the functionalities for a mobile eBanking application. Users will be able to create an account, add funds to their account, transfer funds to other users, and exchange currencies. They can also purchase stocks or cryptocurrencies. Also, the application will provide recommendations for stocks that can be advantageously purchased at that moment.
